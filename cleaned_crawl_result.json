In contrast, a Second Mortgage/Home Equity Loan offers a fixed rate and equal payments, but requires a new application for more funds. A Cash-Out Refinance replaces your mortgage for cash, has variable or fixed rates, and generally higher closing costs.

However, if you leave your job, the entire amount might be due immediately with taxes and penalties.

The margin is an additional percentage that the lender adds to the index. Lenders might offer temporarily discounted introductory or 'teaser' rates, which are unusually low for a short period.

You usually receive these disclosures with the loan application and additional ones before the line of credit opens. Lenders generally cannot charge a nonrefundable fee until three days after you've received these disclosures.

Key differences: a mortgage is a fixed amount for purchasing property, while a HELOC is a revolving credit line typically for home improvements. Mortgages can have fixed or variable rates, whereas most HELOCs have variable rates. Eligibility for both requires a good credit score (e.g., 620+), a Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio of 43% or lower, and a steady income. Mortgages usually require a down payment and liquid reserves; HELOCs require sufficient home equity (15-20%). The mortgage process averages about two months to close, with closing costs of 3-6%. HELOCs average under one month to close, with costs around 2-5%.",

      "content": "Payment option ARMs, common before the 2008 housing crisis, allow borrowers to choose from various payment options, including traditional principal and interest, interest-only, or a minimum payment. A key risk of minimum payments is 'negative amortization,' where your payment doesn't cover all interest due, causing your loan balance to increase instead of decrease. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) provides more information on payment option ARMs and negative amortization on their website. It's crucial to understand these features and their potential financial consequences before committing to such an ARM.",
