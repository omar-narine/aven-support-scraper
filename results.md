Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.</span><li><a>How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.</span><li><a>Does Aven offer a fixed rate? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>Some Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans.

Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card. Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card wherever VISA cards are accepted.<p>Aven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account – it is called a CashOut. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.<p>To transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.</span></ul></div></div><div><div><h5>Payments</h5></div><div><ul><li><a>How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>Aven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit <a href="https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator">https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator</a> </span><li><a>How do you compute my minimum due every month? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>For revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit<a href="https://aven.com/paymentCalculator"> <span>https://aven.com/paymentCalculator</span></a>.</span><li><a>Is there a prepayment penalty? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>There is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here <a href="https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails">https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails</a><p><span>Important Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.</span></span><li><a>How is interest calculated on the Aven account? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>Interest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.<ul><li>For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.<li>For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.<li>Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.</ul><p>In addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.<p>If an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.</span><li><a>When is the monthly payment due? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>Statements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account.

Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>Debt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.<p> <p>As an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.<p> <p>Please note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current. </span><li><a>Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>No, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower’s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved. <p> <p>Aven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.</span><li><a>Who is eligible for Debt Protection? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>In order to qualify, you must:<ul><li>Be under 70 years old<li>Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week<li>Not be self-employed</ul></span><li><a>What is Debt Protection? <img src="https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg" alt="down"></a><span><p>For a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss.
