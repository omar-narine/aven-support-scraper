It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.\n\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.",

In this comprehensive article, we'll examine two popular credit cards—the Home Depot Credit Card and the Aven Home EquityCredit Card—that cater to individuals like you, aiming to streamline their home improvement expenses or optimize their balance transfer strategies.\n\n|  | **Home Depot[**2**](https://www.aven.com/education/home-depot-credit-card-vs-aven-home-equity-credit-card#footnote_2)** | **Aven** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Card Type** | Store Specific | General Purpose |\n| **Rewards** | None | 2% Cashback[1](https://www.aven.com/education/home-depot-credit-card-vs-aven-home-equity-credit-card#footnote_1) |\n| **Annual Fee** | None | None |\n| **APR** | 17.99% - 26.99 | 7.99% - 14.99%[1](https://www.aven.com/education/home-depot-credit-card-vs-aven-home-equity-credit-card#footnote_1) |\n| **Credit Limit** | Not Specified | Up to $250,000 |\n| **Process** | Less stringent | Stricter criteria |\n| **Benefits** | Special financing options, extended return windows | Large lines, low rates, option to cash out, cash back |\n|  | **[Apply Now](https://www.homedepot.com/c/Credit_Center#ConsumerCard)** | **[Apply Now](https://www.aven.com/homeimprovement)** |\n\n[Apply Now](https://www.aven.com/homeimprovement)\n\nWhen it comes to revamping your living space or dealing with existing credit card debt, having the right credit card can be a game-changer. That's why we're here to break down the unique features, rewards, fees, and benefits of these two credit cards, empowering you to make an informed decision based on your specific needs and financial goals.\n\n## Card Features and Rewards:\n\nThe Aven Home Equity Credit Card is a general-purpose credit card that can be used anywhere VISA is accepted. It offers cash back rewards on everyday purchases. These rewards can be redeemed for statement credits.\n\nOn the other hand, the Home Depot Credit Card offers various benefits such as special financing options and access to exclusive cardholder events. The card provides a range of promotional financing offers, including deferred interest and fixed monthly payments, depending on the purchase amount.\n\n## Annual Fees and Interest Rates:\n\nThe Aven Home Equity Credit Card has no annual fee or sign up fee. It has an extremely low interest rate, making it an attractive choice for those looking to save on interest charges.\n\nThe Home Depot Credit Card does not charge an annual fee. However, it's important to note that the card has a relatively high APR (Annual Percentage Rate), which can be significant if you carry a balance from month to month.\n\n## Credit Limit and Approval Process:\n\nThe Home Depot Credit Card typically offers a lower credit limit compared to the Aven Home Equity Credit Card. This is because it is primarily designed for Home Depot purchases and not intended for extensive everyday use. The approval process for the Home Depot Credit Card may be less stringent, making it more accessible to a wider range of credit profiles.\n\nThe Aven Home Equity Credit Card, being a general-purpose credit card, generally offers higher credit limits. However, the approval process may involve stricter criteria, including credit history and income verification, to qualify for higher credit limits.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nBoth the Home Depot Credit Card and the Aven Home Equity Credit Card have their own strengths and cater to different consumer needs. If you are a regular Home Depot shopper, the Home Depot Credit Card can provide you with attractive financing options. However, if you prefer a more versatile credit card with rewards on everyday spending and a wider range of perks, the Aven Home Equity Credit Card may be a better fit.\n\nConsider your spending habits, credit profile, and specific needs before making a decision. Ultimately, choosing the right credit card depends on your personal preferences, financial goals, and the benefits that align with your lifestyle.\n\n[Apply Now](https://www.aven.com/homeimprovement)",

This article also explains where you can use your card and how it differs from the credit cards in your wallet.\n\n**How to get a HELOC Card**\n\nTo use a traditional HELOC, you typically need to transfer funds to a checking account before making purchases or use special checks issued to you by the lender. This process can be complicated, time-consuming and frustrating. Some lenders will instead give you a HELOC Card to use at your convenience so you can access your funds immediately.\n\nHowever, there are several requirements to be eligible to apply, including: proving you have a steady income, being listed on your home’s title, having a certain credit score and possessing a valid ID. If you meet the requirements, the application process typically looks something like this:\n\n1. Complete the online application, which asks questions about yourself and your home\n2. Verify your income by providing pay stubs or a company verification letter\n3. Meet with a notary to sign required documents\n4. Receive your card within a few business days\n\n**Where can HELOC funds be used?**\n\nOnce your card arrives in the mail, you can start making purchases with it right away. You can use your card at any merchant that accepts major credit cards, like Visa and MasterCard.\n\nExperts recommend using a HELOC Card for purchases that help increase wealth over the long run. For example, many homeowners tend to use their funds on home improvements or remodeling, which can significantly increase the property’s value. You can also use the card to transfer balances from personal loans or other credit cards.\n\nWhile there are no restrictions on what products or services you can purchase with a HELOC Card, financial advisors typically advise against using your card on frivolous items or experiences, such as vacations or a new car, which are unlikely to increase your wealth. These types of purchases could even make it harder to pay off your HELOC balance in the future.\n\n**How to pay for charges made on a HELOC Card**\n\nEvery month, you will receive a statement with your charges, much like you do with a traditional credit card. The monthly bill for a HELOC Card from Aven, for example, consists of 1% of the principal balance plus finance and interest charges on the average daily balance during your last billing cycle.\n\nIf you choose to pay only your minimum balance each month, it can take you a very long time to pay your balance back. You can choose to pay more than the minimum or to make payments more often than once a month if you'd like to pay down your debt sooner. If you can't pay your monthly bill on time, you will likely incur a late fee.\n\n**How is a HELOC Card different from a credit card?**\n\nWhile a HELOC Card is used in a similar way as a regular credit card, they are not the same. The main difference is that a HELOC Card uses your home’s equity to secure the loan, while a credit card doesn’t require any collateral. Consequently, HELOC Cards have much lower interest rates than credit cards. However, unlike with a credit card, the rate is usually variable, meaning it moves up and down based on a benchmark rate.\n\nAre you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back. Aven is the world's first home equity-backed credit card and combines the low interest rates of a home equity line of credit with the flexibility of a credit card.

But what is home equity, what can you do with it and how do you tap into it? Keep reading to find out.\n\n**What is Home Equity?**\n\nHome equity is the portion of your home that you have already paid off. It is calculated by subtracting your outstanding mortgage and loan balances from the current market value of your home. For example, if you put 20% down on a house that is worth $200,000 and take out a mortgage to cover the remaining $160,000, then you would have $40,000 of equity in your home. As you pay off the mortgage, your home equity increases until you own your home in its entirety.\n\n**How can I use my Home Equity to access funds?**\n\nWhen you have home equity, you can use that equity as collateral to borrow money in the form of a home equity loan, home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a reverse mortgage. Interest rates on these types of loans tend to be lower than on other types of loans because they are secured by the portion of your home that you own. Choosing an option depends on what you wish to do with the extra cash.\n\nHome Equity Loan\n\nA Home Equity Loan, otherwise known as a second mortgage, is one way to borrow against your home equity and receive all the money in one lump sum at a fixed interest rate. You then make monthly principal and interest payments to pay it off. This type of loan can be useful if you need cash to make a large, one-time payment. A home renovation is a good example. It could also be used to consolidate high-interest debt.\n\nHome Equity Line Of Credit (HELOC)\n\nAnother option is a home equity line of credit or HELOC. A HELOC also uses your home equity as collateral. However, rather than receiving all your money at once, you get access to a line of credit from which you can withdraw money as you need it. The beauty of a HELOC is that you only pay interest on what you use.\n\nThere are two stages of a HELOC. The first is the draw period, during which you can withdraw as much money as you need up to the credit limit. The second is the repayment period, which is when you pay off the debt. Interest rates on HELOCs are usually adjustable, and your monthly payments will vary. A HELOC is a good option if you want to make many smaller improvements to your home over an extended period of time, or if you're not exactly sure how much money you will need.\n\nReverse Mortgage\n\nLastly, if you are at least 62 years old, a reverse mortgage is another choice to consider. As the name suggests, a reverse mortgage is the opposite of a traditional mortgage. Instead of making payments to a lender to earn equity in your home, the lender makes payments to you. Your debt to the lender increases, and your equity decreases as the lender buys it from you. You remain the title holder of your home, but when you sell it, pass away, or move out for more than a year, the loan becomes due. The lender will then sell the house to recover the funds you borrowed, and any remaining equity falls to you or your heirs.\n\nReverse mortgages are most commonly used by elderly adults since you need to be at least 62 years old to apply for one. They can be a good alternative when you want to retire but don't have enough savings and assets to do so. If you are considering a reverse mortgage, make sure to do your research, read the fine print and consult an attorney because scams are common.\n\n**What is a Home Equity Line of Credit Card?**\n\nWhile there are advantages to each of the options mentioned above, the application and approval process can take a few weeks, and getting access to your funds can be a hassle. Perhaps the easiest and fastest way to access your funds is with a HELOC Card, which is similar to a traditional HELOC, but without the need for a checkbook or online transfers. A HELOC Card works just like a credit card and can be used anywhere credit cards are accepted. There are lenders, like [Aven](http://aven.com/), that specialize in these cards and in speeding up the approval process.\n\nTo apply for a HELOC Card, you will need to meet a few requirements like having a stable income, a credit score of around 650 and around 20% equity in your home. Unlike with a traditional HELOC, the entire process can be completed online and doesn’t usually require a home appraisal. All you need to do is answer a few questions about yourself and your home, confirm your income by uploading pay stubs or logging into your bank account and complete an online notarization session to sign paperwork. To learn more about the requirements and steps to getting a HELOC Card as quickly as possible, check out [this article](https://www.aven.com/education/home-equity-line-of-credit-heloc-card-how-it-works).\n\n**Which option is right for me?**\n\nDeciding which option is best depends on many factors, including what you need the money for and how quickly you need access to it. A home equity loan may be best for well-thought out projects with a known cost, while a HELOC is better for ongoing projects in which the costs are variable. However, if you need your funds quickly and want a convenient way to access them, a HELOC Card may be what you're looking for.\n\nHave you decided a HELOC Card is worth looking into? Aven can get you approved in as little as 15 minutes.

It helps you explore and understand your options when borrowing against the equity in your home.\n\nYou can find more information from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) about home loans at cfpb.gov/mortgages. You’ll also find other mortgage-related CFPB resources, facts, and tools to help you take control of your borrowing options.\n\n# About the CFPB\n\nThe CFPB is a 21st century agency that implements and enforces federal consumer financial law and ensures that markets for consumer financial products are fair, transparent, and competitive.\n\nThis pamphlet, titled What you should know about home equity lines of credit, was created to comply with federal law pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1637a(e) and 12 CFR 1026.40(e).\n\n# How can this booklet help you?\n\nThis booklet can help you decide whether home equity line of credit is the right choice for you, and help you shop for the best available option.\n\nA home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a loan that allows you to borrow, spend, and repay as you go, using your home as collateral.\n\nTypically, you can borrow up to a specified percentage of your equity. Equity is the value of your home minus the amount you owe on your mortgage.\n\nConsider a HELOC if you are confident you can keep up with the loan payments. If you fall behind or can’t repay the loan on schedule, you could lose your home.\n\n# After you finish this booklet:\n\nYou’ll understand the effect of borrowing against your home\n\n• You’ll think through your borrowing and financing options, besides a HELOC\n\n• You’ll see how to shop for your best HELOC offer You’ll see what to do if the economy or your situation changes\n\n# Compare a HELOC to other money sources\n\nBefore you decide to take out a HELOC, it might make sense to consider other options that might be available to you, like the ones below.\n\nRenting your home out to other people may be prohibited under the terms of your line of credit.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MONEY SOURCE | HOW MUCH CAN YOU BORROW | VARIABLE OR FIXED RATE | IS YOUR HOME AT RISK? | TYPICAL ADVANTAGES | TYPICAL DISADVANTAGES |\n| HELOC You borrow against the equity in your home | Generally a percentage of the appraised value of your home, minus the amount you owe on your mortgage | Variable. typically | Yes | Continue repaying and borrowing for several years without additional approvals or paperwork | Repaymentamount varies; repayment is often required when you sell your home |\n| SECOND MORTGAGE OR HOME EQUITY LOAN You borrow against theequity inyour | Generally a percentage of the appraised value of your home, minus the amount mortgwe on your | Fixed | Yes | Equal payments that pay off the entire loan | If you need more money, you need to apply for a new loan; repayment is often required when you sell your home |\n| CASH-OUT REFINANCE You replace your existing mortgage with abigger mortgage and take the difference in cash | Generally a percentage of the appraised value of your home; the amount of your existing loan plus the amount you want to cash out | Variable or fixed | Yes | Continue to make just one mortgage payment | Closing costs are generally higher; it may take longer to pay off your mortgage;interest rate may be higher than your current mortgage |\n| PERSONAL LINE OF CREDIT You borrow based on your credit,without using your home as collateral | Up to your credit limit, as determined by the lender | Variable, typically | No | Continue repaying and borrowing for several years without additional approvals or paperwork | Solid credit is required; you may need to pay the entire amount due once a year; higher interest rate than a loan that uses your home as collateral |\n\nCompare a HELOC to other money sources\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MONEY SOURCE | HOW MUCH CAN YOU | VARIABLE OR FIXED RATE | IS YOUR HOME AT RISK? | TYVICATAGES | TYPICVANTAGES |\n| RETIREMENTPLAN LOAN You borrow from your retirement savings in a 401(k) or similar plan through your current employer | Generally, up to 50% of your vrst5ed,000ance whichever is less | Fixed | No | Repay through paycheck dedurtons: required but no credit check and no impact on your credit score | If you leave or lose your job, repay the whotimmountat taxes and penalties; spouse may need to consent |\n| HOME EQUITY CONVERSION MORTGAGE (HECM) You must be age 62 orolder,and you borrow against the equity in your home | Depends on your age,the interest rate on your loan, and the value of your home | Fixed or variable | Yes | You don't make monthly loan payments- instead,you typically repay the loan when you move out,or your survivors repay it after you die | The amount you owe grows over time; you might not have any value left in your home if you want to leave it to your heirs |\n| CREDIT CARD You borrow money from the credit card company and repay as you go | Up to the amount of your credit limit, as determined by the credit card company | Fixed or variable | No | No minimum purchase; consumer protections in the case of fraud or lost or stolen card | Higher interest rate than a loan that uses your home as collateral |\n| FRIENDS AND FAMILY You borrow money from someone you are close to | Agreed on by the borrower and lender | Variable, fixed or other | No | Reduced waiting time, fees,and pomprared.to a formal loan | Forgiven loans and unreported or fomipenitrest.can especially for large loans; can jeopardize important personal relationships if something goes wrong |\n\n# How HELOCs work\n\n# PREPARE FOR UP-FRONT COSTS\n\nSome lenders waive some or all of the up-front costs for a HELOC. Others may charge fees. For example, you might get charged:\n\nA fee for a property appraisal, which is a formal estimate of the value of your home An application fee, which might not be refunded if you are turned down Closing costs, including fees for attorneys, title search, mortgage preparation and filing, property and title insurance, and taxes\n\n# PULL MONEY FROM YOUR LINE OF CREDIT\n\nOnce approved for a HELOC, you can generally spend up to your credit limit whenever you want. When your line of credit is open for spending, you are in the you are in the borrowing period, also called the draw period. Typically, you use special checks or a credit card to draw on your line. Some plans require you to borrow a minimum amount each time (for example, $$ 300$ or keep a minimum amount outstanding. Some plans require you to take an initial amount when the credit line is set up.\n\n# MAKE REPAYMENTS DURING THE “DRAW PERIOD”\n\nSome plans set a minimum monthly payment that includes a portion of the principal (the amount you borrow) plus accrued interest. The portion of your payment that goes toward principal typically does not repay the principal by the end of the term. Other plans may allow payment of the interest only, during the draw period, which means that you pay nothing toward the principal.\n\nIf your plan has a variable interest rate, your monthly payments may change even if you don’t draw more money.\n\n# ENTER THE “REPAYMENT PERIOD”\n\nWhatever your payment arrangements during the draw period—whether you pay some, a little, or none of the principal amount of the loan—when the draw period ends you enter a repayment period. Your lender may set a schedule so that you repay the full amount, often over ten or 15 years.\n\nOr, you may have to pay the entire balance owed, all at once, which might be a large amount called a balloon payment. You must be prepared to make this balloon payment by refinancing it with the lender, getting a loan from another lender, or some other means. If you are unable to pay the balloon payment in full, you could lose your home.\n\n# RENEW OR CLOSE OUT THE LINE OF CREDIT\n\nAt the end of the repayment period, your lender might encourage you to leave the line of credit open. This way you don’t have to go through the cost and expense of a new loan, if you expect to borrow again. Be sure you understand if annual maintenance fees or other fees apply, even if you are not actively using the credit line.\n\n# TIP\n\nIf you sell your home, you are generally required to pay off your HELOC in full immediately. If you are likely to sell your home in the near future, consider whether or not to pay the up-front costs of setting up a line of credit.\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GETTHREEHELOCESTIMATES Shopping around lets you compare costs and features, so you can feel confident you're making the best choice for your situation. | OFFER A | OFFER B | OFFER C |\n| Initiating the HELOC |  |  |  |\n| Credit limit $ |  |  |  |\n| First transaction $ |  |  |  |\n| Minimum transaction $ |  |  |  |\n| Minimum balance $ |  |  |  |\n| Fixed annual percentage rate % |  |  |  |\n| Variable annual percentage rate % |  |  |  |\n| 》 Index used and current value |  |  |  |\n| 》 Amount of margin |  |  |  |\n| 》 Frequency of rate adjustments |  |  |  |\n| Amount/length of discount rate (if any) 》 |  |  |  |\n| 》 Interest rate cap and floor |  |  |  |\n| Length of plan |  |  |  |\n| Draw period |  |  |  |\n| 》 Repayment period |  |  |  |\n| Initial fees |  |  |  |\n| 》 Appraisal fee $ |  |  |  |\n| Application fee $ |  |  |  |\n\n# ET THREE HELOC ESTIMATES\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Shopping around lets you compare costs and features,so you can feel confident you're making the | OFFER A | OFFER B | OFFER C |\n|  | best choice for your situation.

Common indexes include the U.S. prime rate and the Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) rate. Talk with your lender to find out more about the index they use.\n\nThe margin is an extra percentage that the lender adds to the index.\n\nLenders sometimes offer a temporarily discounted interest rate for home equity lines—an introductory or teaser rate that is unusually low for a short period, such as six months.\n\n# Rights and responsibilities\n\nLenders are required to disclose the terms and costs of their home equity lines of credit. They need to tell you:\n\nAnnual percentage rate (APR)\n\nInformation about variable rates\n\nPayment terms\n\nRequirements on transactions, such as\n\nminimum draw amounts and number of draws\n\nallowed per year\n\nAnnual fees Miscellaneous charges\n\nYou usually get these disclosures when you receive a loan application, and you get additional disclosures before the line of credit is opened. In general, the lender cannot charge a nonrefundable fee as part of your application until three days after you have received the disclosures.\n\nIf the lender changes the terms before the loan is made, you can decide not to go forward with it, and the lender must return all fees. There is one exception: the variable interest rate might change, and in that case if you decide not to go ahead with the loan, your fees are not refunded.\n\nLenders must give you a list of HUD-approved housing counselors in your area. You can talk to counselor about how HELOCs work and get free or low-cost help with budgeting and money management.\n\n# Right to cancel (also called right to rescind)\n\nIf you change your mind for any reason, under federal law, you can cancel the credit line in the first three days. Notify the lender in writing within the first three days after the account was opened. The lender must then cancel the loan and return the fees you paid, including application and appraisal fees.\n\n# TIP\n\nSome HELOCs let you convert some of your balance to a fixed interest rate. The fixed interest rate is typically higher than the variable rate, but it means more predictable payments.\n\n# If something changes during the course of the loan\n\nHELOCs generally permit the lender to freeze or reduce your credit line if the value of your home falls or if they see a change for the worse in your financial situation. If this happens, you can:\n\nTalk with your lender. Find out the reason for the freeze or reduction. You might need to check your credit reports for errors that might have caused a downgrade in your credit. Or, you might need to talk with your lender about a new appraisal on your home and make sure the lender agrees to accept a new appraisal as valid.\n\nShop for another line of credit. If another lender offers you a line of credit, you may be able to use that to pay off your original line of credit. Application fees and other fees may apply for the new loan.\n\n# WELL DONE!\n\nFor most people, a home is their most valuable asset. A HELOC can help you make the most of this asset, when you understand the ins and outs and know what to expect.\n\n# In this booklet:\n\n# SK YOURSELF\n\nHave I considered other sources of money and loans, besides a HELOC?\n\nHave I shopped around for HELOC features and fees?\n\nAm I comfortable with the worst-case scenario, where I could lose my home?\n\n![](https://www.aven.com/docs/images/730612018b3cb859015ed94655ea8c5a2a76fc7e850289362956599083f92084.jpg)\n\n# NLINE TOOLS\n\nCFPB website cfpb.gov\n\nAnswers to common questions cfpb.gov/askcfpb\n\nTools and resources for home buyers cfpb.gov/owning-a-home\n\nTalk to a HUD-approved housing counselor cfpb.gov/find-a-housing-counselor\n\nSubmit a complaint cfpb.gov/complaint",

When you apply for an ARM loan, you receive a Loan Estimate. You can request and receive multiple Loan Estimates from competing lenders to find your best deal.\n\nYou may want to have your Loan Estimate handy for any loan you are considering as you work through this booklet. We reference a sample Loan Estimate throughout the booklet to help you apply the information to your situation.\n\nYou can find more information about ARMs at cfpb.gov/about-arms. You’ll also find other mortgage-related CFPB resources, facts, and tools to help you take control of the homebuying process.\n\n# About the CFPB\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regulates the offering and provision of consumer financial products and services under the federal consumer financial laws and educates and empowers consumers to make better informed financial decisions.\n\nThis booklet, titled Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages, was created to comply with federal law pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 2604 and 12 CFR 1026.19(b)(1).\n\n# How can this booklet help you?\n\nThis booklet can help you decide whether an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is the right choice for you and to help you take control of the homebuying process.\n\nYour lender may have already provided you with a copy of Your Home Loan Toolkit. You can also download the Toolkit from the CFPB’s Buying a House guide at cfpb.gov/buy-ahouse/.\n\nAn ARM is a mortgage with an interest rate that changes, or “adjusts,” throughout the loan.\n\nWith an ARM, the interest rate and monthly payment may start out low. However, both the rate and the payment can increase very quickly.\n\nConsider an ARM only if you can afford increases in your monthly payment—even to the maximum amount.\n\n# After you finish this booklet:\n\n• You’ll understand how an ARM works and whether it’s the right choice for you. (page 2) You’ll know how to review important documents when you apply for an ARM. (page 6) You’ll understand the risks that come with different types of ARMs. (page 18)\n\n# Is an ARM right for you?\n\nARMs come with the risk of higher payments in the future that you might not be able to predict. But in some situations, an ARM might make sense for you. If you are considering an ARM, be sure to understand the tradeoffs.\n\n# TIP\n\nDon’t count on being able to refinance before your interest rate and monthly payments increase. You might not qualify for refinancing if the value of your home goes down or if something unexpected damages your financial situation, like a job loss or medical costs.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| COMPARE | FIXED-RATE MORTGAGE | ADJUSTABLE-RATEMORTGAGE |\n| Consider this option if | · You prefer predictable payments,or · You plan to keep your home for a long period of time | You are confident you can afford increases in your monthly payment-even to the maximum amount,or You plan to sell your home within a short period of time |\n| Interest rate | ·Setwhen you take out the loan ·Stays the same for the entire loan term | Based on an index that changes May start out lower than a fixed rate mortgage but you bear the risk of increases throughout your loan |\n| Monthly payment | ■Principal and interest payment stays the same over the life of your loan ■You know the total you will pay in principal and interest over the life of the loan | Initial principal and interest payment amount remains in effect for a limited period You can't know in advance how much total interest you will pay because your interest rate changes If you can't afford the increased payments, you may lose your home to foreclosure |\n\n# Learn about how ARMs work\n\nAs you decide whether to move ahead with an ARM, you should understand how they work and how your housing costs can be affected.\n\n# Interest rate $\\\\mathbf { \\\\tau } =$ index + margin\n\nThe interest rate on an ARM has two parts: the index and the margin.\n\n# INDEX\n\nAn index is a measure of interest rates generally that reflects trends in the overall economy. Different lenders use different indexes for their ARM programs.\n\nCommon indexes include the U.S. prime rate and the Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) rate. Talk with your lender to find out more about the index they use, which is also shown on your Loan Estimate.\n\n# MARGIN\n\nThe margin is an extra percentage that the lender adds to the index.\n\nYou can shop around to different lenders to find the lowest combination of the index plus the margin. Your Loan Estimate shows the index and the margin being offered to you.\n\n# Changes to initial rate and payment\n\nThe initial interest rate and initial principal and interest payment amount on an ARM remain in effect for a limited period.\n\nSo, when you see ARMs advertised as 5/1 or 5/6m ARMs:\n\nThe first number tells you the length of time your initial interest rate lasts. The second number tells you how often the rate changes after that.\n\nFor example, during the first five years in a 5/6m ARM your rate stays the same. After that, the rate may adjust every six months (the 6m in the 5/6m example) until the loan is paid off. This period between rate changes is called the adjustment period. Adjustment periods can vary. Some last a month, a year, or like this example, six months.\n\nFor some ARMs, the initial rate and payment can be very different from the rates and payments later in the loan term. Even if the market for interest rates is stable, your rates and payments could change a lot.\n\n# Use your Loan Estimate to understand your ARM\n\n# Product\n\n![](https://www.aven.com/docs/images/af59a75f4e5ea9c919f3f8d373777773a45b1d1059dfe9e8d18f3ae4323d2f3f.jpg)\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Adjustable |  |\n|  | Adjustable Interest Rate (AIR) Table |\n|  | Index+Maglnate |\n|  | 1 YearCmt+25%6 |\n|  | Minimum/Maximum Interest Rate 2.25% / 8% |\n| Interest Rate | Change Frequency |\n|  | First Change Beginning of 61st month |\n| (AIR) Table |  | Subsequent Changes Every12monthsafterfirstchange Limits on Interest Rate Changes |\n|  | First Change 2% |\n|  | Subsequent Changes 2% |\n|  |  |\n| LOAN ESTIMATE | PAGE 2 OF 3 · LOAN ID # 123456789 |\n|  |  |\n|  |\n\n# Loan terms\n\n# INTEREST RATE\n\nThe Loan Estimate shows the initial interest rate you pay at the beginning of your loan term. This row also shows how often your rate can change and how high it can go.\n\n# MONTHLY PRINCIPAL & INTEREST\n\nThe Loan Estimate shows the initial monthly principal and interest payment you’ll make if you accept this loan. Your principal is the money that you originally agreed to pay back on your loan. Interest is a cost you pay to borrow the principal. The initial principal and interest payment amount for an ARM is set only for the initial period and may change after that.\n\n# THE TALK\n\nYou might hear, “An ARM makes sense because you can refinance the loan before your interest rate and monthly payment increase.”\n\nAsk yourself, a spouse, or a loved one:\n\n“What if the market value of the home goes down?”\n\n“What if our financial situation or our credit score gets damaged by something unexpected like a job loss or illness?”\n\n“If we can’t refinance at a better rate, can we afford the maximum interest rate and payment increase under this loan?”\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loan Terms | Can this amount increase after closing? |\n| Loan Amount | $216,000 | NO |  |\n| Interest Rate | 3% | YES | · Adjusts every year starting in year 6 · Can go as high as 8% in year 8 · See AIR Table for details |\n| Monthly Principal & Interest SeeProjected PaymentsBelow forYourTotalMonthlyPayment | $910.66 | YES | · Adjusts every year starting in year 6 · Can go as high as $1,467 in year 8 |\n| Prepayment Penalty |  | Does the loan have these features? |\n| Balloon Payment | NO | NO |\n\n# Example of “Loan terms” section.

Find this on page 1 of your own Loan Estimate\n\n# Projected payments\n\n# PRINCIPAL & INTEREST\n\nThe monthly principal and interest payment on your ARM is likely to change after the initial period. Review this section to see how your payment can change based on your loan’s interest rate.\n\n# ESTIMATED TOTAL MONTHLY PAYMENT\n\nReview this row to see the total minimum and maximum monthly payments. The payments include mortgage insurance, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and any additional property assessments or other escrow items. Learn more about these mortgage terms at cfpb.gov/mortgage-terms/\n\nKeep in mind that other parts of your monthly and annual housing costs can change, such as your property taxes and homeowners insurance payments.\n\n# THE TALK\n\nTalk over how your financial life could be affected if your ARM monthly payment increases. In future years, you might face money decisions like:\n\nJob changes School or other education expenses Medical needs and expenses\n\nBecause ARM adjustments are unpredictable, you might have less or more financial flexibility for other parts of your life.\n\n# Adjustable Interest Rate (AIR) table\n\nYou should read and understand the AIR table calculations before committing to an ARM. It's important to know how your interest rate changes over the life of your loan.\n\n# INDEX $^ +$ MARGIN\n\nYour lender is required to show you how your interest rate is calculated, which is determined by the index and margin on your loan. See page 2 of this booklet for more about index and margin.\n\n# INITIAL INTEREST RATE\n\nThis is the interest rate at the beginning of your loan. The initial interest rate changes to the index plus the margin at your first adjustment (subject to the limits on interest rate changes). Your loan servicer tells you your new payment amount seven to eight months in advance, so you can budget for it or shop for a new loan.\n\n# MINIMUM/MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE\n\nThis shows how low or high your interest rate could be over the life of your loan. Generally, an ARM’s interest rate is never lower than the margin.\n\n# CHANGE FREQUENCY\n\n# “TEASER” RATES\n\nThis indicates when the interest rate on your loan will change. Your loan servicer sends you advance notices of changes.\n\n# LIMITS ON INTEREST RATE CHANGES\n\nThis shows the highest amount your interest rate can increase when there is a change.\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| Adjustable Interest Rate (AlR) Table |\n| Index + Margin 1 Year Cmt+ 2.5% |\n| Initial Interest Rate 3% |\n| Minimum/Maximum Interest Rate 2.5%/8% |\n| Change Frequency |\n| First Change Beginning of 61st month |\n| Subsequent Changes Every 12 months after first change |\n| Limits on Interest Rate Changes |\n| First Change 2% |\n| Subsequent Changes 2% |\n\nExample of “AIR table” section. Find this on page 2 of your own Loan Estimate\n\nSome lenders offer a “teaser,” “start,” or “discounted” rate that is lower than their fully indexed rate. When the teaser rate ends, your loan takes on the fully indexed rate. Don’t assume that a loan with a teaser rate is a good one for you. Not everyone’s budget can accommodate a higher payment.\n\nConsider this example:\n\nA lender’s fully indexed rate is $4 . 5 %$ (the index is $2 %$ and the margin is $2 . 5 %$ ). The loan also features a “teaser” rate of $3 %$ . Even if the index doesn’t change, your interest rate still increases from $3 %$ to $4 . 5 %$ when your teaser rate expires.\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| COMPARE YOUR ARM OFFERS Shopforat least three loanoffers,andfill intheblanks | ARM OFFER 1 |  | FIXED-RATE OFFER |\n| below using the information on your Loan Estimates: Lender name |  | ARM OFFER 2 |  |\n| Loan amount | $ | $ | $ |\n| Initial interest rate | % | % | % |\n| Initial principal and interest payment |  |  | $ |\n| Index | $ | s |  |\n| Margin |  |  |  |\n| How long will the initial interest rate and initial payment apply? |  |  |  |\n| How high can my interest rate go? |  |  |  |\n| How high can my principal and interest payment go? | % | % | % |\n\n# THE TALK\n\nMy best loan offer is:\n\nYou are in control of whether or not to proceed with an ARM. If you prefer to proceed with a fixed-rate mortgage, here is one way to start the conversation with a lender:\n\n“\u0003A fixed-rate mortgage seems to be a better fit for me. Let’s talk about what you can offer and how it compares to other loans I may be able to get.”\n\n# Review your lender’s ARM program disclosure\n\nYour lender gives you an ARM program disclosure when they give you an application. This is the lender’s opportunity to tell you about their different ARM loans and how the loans work. The index and margin can differ from one lender to another, so it is helpful to compare offers from different lenders.\n\nGenerally, the index your lender uses won’t change after you get your loan, but your loan contract may allow the lender to switch to a different index in some situations.\n\n# \u0007GATHER FACTS\n\nReview your program disclosure and ask your lender questions to understand their ARM loan offerings:\n\nHow are the interest rate and payment\n\ndetermined?\n\nDoes this loan have interest-rate caps (that\n\nis, limits on interest rate changes)?\n\nHow often do the interest rate and\n\npayment adjust?\n\nWhat index is used and where is it published?\n\nIs the initial interest rate lower than the fully\n\nindexed rate? (see “Teaser rates,” on page 12)\n\nWhat type of information is provided in notices\n\nof adjustment and when do I receive them?\n\n# Ask about other options offered by your lender\n\n# Conversion option\n\nYour loan agreement may include a clause that lets you convert the ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage in the future.\n\nWhen you convert, the new rate is generally set using a formula given in your loan documents. That fixed rate may be higher or lower than interest rates available to you in the market at that time. Also your lender may charge you a conversion fee. Ask your lender whether the loan you are being offered has a conversion feature and how it works.\n\n# Special features\n\nYou can shop around to understand what special ARM features may be available from different lenders.\n\nNot all programs are the same. Talk with your lender to find out if there’s anything special about their ARM programs that you may find valuable.\n\n# Check your ARM for features that could pose risks\n\nSome types of ARMs have features that can reduce your payments in the short term but may include fees or the risk of higher payments later. Review your loan terms and make sure that you understand the fees and how your rate and payment may change. Lower payments at the beginning could mean higher fees or much higher payments later.\n\n# Paying points to reduce your initial interest rate\n\nLenders can offer you a lower rate in exchange for paying loan fees at closing, or points.\n\nWith an ARM, paying points often reduces your interest rate only until the end of the initial period—the reduction most likely does not apply over the life of your loan.\n\nIf you are using an ARM to refinance a loan, points are often rolled into your new loan amount. You might not realize you are paying points unless you look carefully. Points are disclosed on the top of Page 2 of your Loan Estimate.\n\nLenders may give you the option to pay points, but you never have to take that option. To figure out if you have a good deal, compare your cost in points with the amount that you will save with a lower interest rate.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Loan Costs |  |\n| A. Origination Charges | $3,160 |\n| 1% of Loan Amount (Points) | $2,160 |\n| Application Fee | $500 |\n| Processing Fee | $500 |\n\nExample of “Loan costs” section. Find this on page 2 of your own Loan Estimate\n\n# THE TALK\n\nIf your Loan Estimate shows points, ask your lender:\n\n“\u0007What is my interest rate if I choose not to pay points?”\n\n“\u0007How much money do I pay in points? And, compared to the total reduction in my payments during the initial period, am I coming out ahead?”\n\n“\u0007Can I see a revised Loan Estimate with the points removed and the interest rate adjusted?”\n\n# Interest-only ARMs\n\nWith an interest-only ARM payment plan, you pay only the interest for a specified number of years. During this interest-only period, you have smaller monthly payments, but you are not paying anything toward your mortgage loan balance.\n\nWhen the interest-only period ends, your monthly payment increases—even if interest rates stay the same—because you must start paying back the principal plus the interest each month. Your monthly payments can increase a lot. The longer the interest-only period, the more your monthly payments increase after the interest-only period ends.\n\n# Payment option ARMs\n\nPayment option ARMs were common before 2008 when the housing crisis began, and some lenders might still offer them.\n\nA payment option ARM means the borrower can choose from different payment options, such as:\n\n• A traditional principal and interest payment An interest-only payment (see above) A minimum payment, which could result in negative amortization\n\nNegative amortizatiion happens when you are not paying enough to cover all of the interest due. Your loan balance goes up instead of down.\n\n# \u0007GATHER FACTS\n\nLearn more information about payment option ARMs and negative amortization at:\n\ncfpb.gov/payment-option-arm/ cfpb.gov/negative-amortization/\n\n# WELL DONE!\n\nChoosing the right home loan is just as important as choosing the right home. By equipping yourself with knowledge about ARMs, you can decide whether or not this type of loan is the right choice for you.\n\n# Consumer Handbook on Adjustable-Rate Mortgages\n\n# ASK YOUR LENDER\n\n• How high can my payment go? • How high can my interest rate go? • How long is my initial principal and interest payment guaranteed?\n\n# ASK YOURSELF\n\n• Have I shopped around to compare ARMs and fixed-rate loans?\n\n• If an ARM has a lower initial interest rate than a fixed-rate mortgage, is paying less money now worth the risk of an increase later?\n\n• Can I afford the highest payment possible with the ARM if I can’t sell the home, or refinance into a lower rate, before the increase?\n\n# ONLINE TOOLS\n\nCFPB website cfpb.gov\n\nAnswers to common questions cfpb.gov/askcfpb\n\nTools and resources for home buyers cfpb.gov/owning-a-home\n\nTalk to a housing counselor cfpb.gov/find-a-housing-counselor\n\nSubmit a complaint cfpb.gov/complaint",

When trying to decide what kind of loan is best suited to you and your situation, it's essential to know the differences between the two and the benefits and drawbacks of each. This article will explain how each type of loan works and explore what the key similarities and differences are.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Mortgages and HELOCs are two types of loans that both use your property as collateral. This means that if you end up defaulting on your payments, you can end up losing your home.\n- A mortgage is a fixed amount used to purchase property, while a HELOC is a revolving line of credit typically tapped for home improvements or renovations after a home is already bought.\n- A mortgage can have a fixed or variable interest rate. Most HELOCs have variable interest rates.\n- Mortgages and HELOCs share a lot of the same requirements for eligibility, such as a good credit score, Debt-to-Income Ratio at 43% or lower, and a steady income.\n- Getting a HELOC is usually quicker than getting a mortgage. However, the timeline varies a lot and depends on your lender and location, among other things.\n\n## How Does a Mortgage Work?\n\nA mortgage is a loan used to purchase property when you don’t wish to buy it outright using cash. Instead of paying the whole amount that the home is worth upfront, you make a down payment (the general rule of thumb is at least 20% of the total price), and get a mortgage to cover the rest. The home you are buying serves as collateral for the loan. The mortgage, which includes a principal amount and interest, is paid back in monthly installments over a determined period of time. Once you've paid off the whole amount you owe, you will own the property in its entirety. Mortgage rates can be either adjustable or fixed.\n\nTo be eligible for a mortgage, you need to meet certain requirements. The lender will typically run a credit check, and the higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate and mortgage payment will generally be. For a conventional mortgage, a score of 620 or higher is often required.\n\nYou will need to prove to the lender that you have a steady income. This can be done by showing proof of employment, pay stubs, tax returns, and other documents. The lender also looks at your mortgage reserves – cash or any assets you have that can be easily converted into cash if you were to find yourself facing financial hardship and struggling to make payments. Investments in stocks, bonds, and funds, and money in checkings and savings accounts are some of the liquid assets that may be considered reserves.\n\nThe lender will also look at your DTI or Debt-to-Income Ratio. This is calculated by dividing your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recommends a DTI of 43% or less.\n\nThe process of getting a mortgage begins with you applying to a mortgage lender. The lender will first verify if you meet the requirements and will be able to pay back the loan. If you are approved, they will come back with an offer of a loan at a specific interest rate to be repaid over a set amount of time. If you accept the lender's offer, you will go through a closing process, where you meet with the seller of the property to pay the down payment, have them sign over the property to you, and sign documents.\n\nFilling out the paperwork for the mortgage application won’t take long, but getting approved, having the appraisal done, receiving a final offer and finalizing the closing procedure can be a lengthy process. After researching mortgages and finding a property you want to purchase (which can also take quite some time), you’re looking at a timeline of approximately two months before you have the keys in your hand. According to Ellie Mae, a software company that processes mortgage applications, the average time to close purchase mortgage loans was 51 days in March 2021. Because there are so many steps in the process, however, there is no guaranteed timeline and the amount of time it takes to get a mortgage varies greatly.\n\nThe mortgage process also comes with a closing cost, which can include origination and appraisal fees, real estate commissions, taxes, insurance fees, title fees and more. The average closing cost is around 3-6% of the purchase price, but it varies depending on your mortgage lender, location and loan type.\n\n## How Does a HELOC Work?\n\nA Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is a type of loan that lets you borrow against home equity, typically to spend on repairs and improvements of the property. It uses your home as collateral, just like a mortgage. However, unlike a mortgage, a HELOC gives you access to a revolving line of credit from which you can borrow money, pay it back, and borrow again during the first phase of the loan called the draw period. During this time, you usually only pay interest on what funds you actually borrow. The draw period generally lasts five to 10 years and is followed by the repayment period, where you pay back your remaining balance through monthly payments of principal and interest. HELOC rates are typically adjustable and vary over time.\n\nTo be eligible for a HELOC, you need to meet a lot of the same requirements as for a mortgage, except for the mortgage reserves.\n\nJust like with a mortgage, the lender will look at your Debt-to-Income Ratio, which needs to be 43% or lower. You will also still need a credit score of around 620, depending on your DTI and the amount of equity you have in your home.\n\nThe home equity you own is the current price of your property minus any balance you owe on mortgages and loans against it, calculated as a percentage. To be eligible to apply for a HELOC, the minimum equity required is typically about 15-20%.\n\nHELOC lenders will also want to know that you can make payments and will therefore require you to prove employment and a steady income as well. Read more about the HELOC application process [here](https://www.aven.com/education/the-fastest-way-to-get-a-heloc).\n\nWhen you apply for a HELOC, the lender evaluates the above-mentioned information to determine if you are a good candidate for a line of credit. If you meet the requirements, the lender will give you an initial offer. Following this, they will likely want to do an appraisal of your home to determine its value and then come back with a final offer.\n\nCompleting the steps described above and receiving a final offer typically takes between two and six weeks. The average processing time for HELOCs, from application to underwriter final decision, was 21 days in 2019, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The process can be shorter or longer depending on your situation. The last step is for you to visit the office to sign the paperwork, and then, after about a three-day waiting period, you can access your funds through online transfers or issued checks.\n\nGetting a HELOC also comes with closing costs, in most cases of around 2-5% of the total loan amount, but it varies greatly depending on the lender. The closing cost can include application/origination fee, appraisal fee, title and escrow fees and fees for notaries and attorneys, among others.\n\nSome lenders can get you through the process of getting a HELOC faster. Applying for a HELOC Card, rather than a traditional HELOC can help you speed things along, and it may also come with fewer fees.

In that case, it's essential to understand what HELOC interest rates are based on, what affects them, and how to find the lowest ones. This article will explain how you can secure the best HELOC rates.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- Your HELOC rate is based on two main factors: the prime rate used by banks and a margin determined by your financial situation and history.\n- When determining your margin or markup, the lender will look at your credit score and CLTV, among other things.\n- To improve your chances of scoring a low HELOC interest rate, stay on top of your credit score and make sure you have enough home equity.\n- Keep in mind that different lenders will offer different rates, so make sure you shop around and consider all your options to find the best rates.\n\n**A quick look at how HELOC rates work**\n\nThe typical HELOC has an adjustable interest rate, which means it can rise and fall over the loan term. There are two main factors that determine the interest on your credit line – the prime rate used by your lender, which is variable, and a margin determined by your financial situation and history, which remains constant.\n\nThe prime rate, which is the interest commercial banks charge their biggest, most creditworthy clients, is largely dependent on the federal funds rate set by the monetary-policy setting committee at the Federal Reserve. So when the Fed decides to raise or lower the federal funds rate, your bank’s benchmark prime rate follows in the same direction, and so does your HELOC rate.\n\nAs for the margin, your lender will look at your payment history, CLTV (Combined Loan-to-Value ratio), and FICO credit score because they want to make sure that you will be able to keep up with payments when the time comes to repay what you've borrowed. Therefore, the riskier the lender finds it to lend you money, the higher the rates you will get. Lenders often look for a credit score of at least 620 and a CLTV under 80%, although this will vary by lender.\n\nThe amount of money you want to borrow and the duration of your HELOC can affect your rates as well. You can learn more about what HELOC rates are based upon in [this article](http://aven.com/education/how-are-heloc-rates-determined).\n\n**How do I secure the lowest rate?**\n\nNow that you know how HELOC rates generally work let's look at some strategies for securing a low rate.\n\nShop around and compare\n\nWhen trying to find the best HELOC rate, the first thing you need to do is check with several lenders and compare what they offer. Rates can vary greatly depending on the lender, so make sure to consider all your options. Look at big national banks, smaller local banks, credit unions, and online lenders to find the best one. Keep in mind that you need to look at more than the initial rate to get a good sense of the most beneficial offer. Check how long the initial rate will last, what will happen after it expires, and the maximum rate. Also, look up any closing costs, balloon payments, inactivity fees, annual fees, and other hidden fees. Consider all these factors when comparing lenders. Keep in mind that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some lenders have halted HELOC applications, and others have significantly raised their requirements.\n\nAnother crucial step to securing a low HELOC rate is making sure your FICO credit score is the best it can be. Whether your score is excellent or below average can significantly affect the margin your lender will add on top of the prime rate, so before applying for a HELOC, you will want to do what you can to maintain good credit. Check that you don't have any old debt weighing your score down, and make sure to make payments on time. Accounts being sent to collections and late payments affect your score; the later, the worse. Don't take on any new debt right before your HELOC application, as this can negatively affect your credit as well. Also, don't close any old credit accounts right before applying, even if they are fully paid off, since this would reduce the total amount of revolving credit available to you. If your credit utilization ratio, or the total debt you're carrying divided by the total credit available to you, increases, it may negatively impact your credit score.\n\nHave enough home equity\n\nMake sure you have enough equity in your home before applying if you want your rate to be as low as possible. The more equity you have, the less risky you will look to lenders. High equity means a low CLTV or Combined Loan-to-Value ratio. Your CLTV is calculated by adding up your loan balances and dividing by the appraised value of your home. Many lenders want you to have around 20% equity and a CLTV of under 80%. However, it varies, and some may accept as low as 10-15% equity. If you have very little equity, you may want to consider waiting and trying to pay off a bit more of your mortgage before applying for a HELOC.\n\n**Consider an alternative**\n\nOne alternative to a traditional HELOC is a HELOC Card. A HELOC Card works just like any other credit card on the market and allows you to access funds immediately to pay for items and services when you need them. However, unlike other credit cards, it is backed by your home equity, just like a HELOC loan. This can lead to significantly lower interest rates compared to other credit cards.\n\nIf you are looking for a more affordable alternative to a HELOC, a HELOC Card could be beneficial as it may come with significantly lower fees. For example, you could be avoiding closing costs, appraisal fees, annual fees, and inactivity fees. Also, if you use your HELOC Card to pay for home improvements, the interest on your HELOC Card may be tax-deductible.\n\nThe Aven HELOC Card is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back. Aven is the world's first home equity backed credit card and combines the low interest rates of a home equity line of credit with the flexibility of a credit card.

But how do you apply, and what is the fastest way to get approved and get access to those funds?\n\n**Getting a HELOC the Traditional Way**\n\nTo qualify for a traditional HELOC, you will need to meet a few requirements in regards to your income, credit and percentage of equity in your home. The exact requirements vary by lender, but let's take a look at the most common conditions.\n\nThe first and, arguably, most important metric lenders look at when you apply for a HELOC is your credit score. Most lenders require a FICO® score of at least 620 to qualify for a HELOC, but the minimum could be set as high as 680. Some will approve you with a score under 620 if you have a low debt-to-income ratio or a high percentage of equity in your home.\n\nAs mentioned above, your debt-to-income ratio also matters. This ratio tells a lender whether or not you can afford to make payments on your line of credit, and is calculated by totaling your monthly debt payments, as well as other financial obligations, and dividing that number by your total monthly income. The resulting percentage is your debt-to-income ratio. Most lenders abide by guidelines set by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which recommends a debt-to-income ratio below 43%. Regardless, the lower this percentage, the easier it will be to qualify for a HELOC. Lenders will also evaluate your payment history on other loans to ensure you make payments on time and determine how risky it will be to lend you money.\n\nYou will also need to prove that you have a steady income so that lenders can be confident you’ll pay back your line of credit. Typically, providing pay stubs or your most recent W-2 is sufficient.\n\nNext, you need to have enough equity in your home. Lenders usually look for at least 15 to 20 percent of equity compared to your home’s value. To determine your equity, subtract the amount you owe on your mortgage from the current value of your home. For example, if you owe $200,000 on your mortgage and your home is valued at $350,000, your home equity is $150,000 (or 43%).\n\nOnce the lender has received and evaluated the above information, you’ll receive an initial decision within a few days. However, rather than taking your word for it, many lenders will perform a home appraisal of their own to confirm the equity amount. This process involves a professional visiting your property to assess its value based on location, age, recent home improvements, curb appeal, nearby attractions and the current housing market.\n\nThe above steps can take a few weeks to complete before you receive a final decision on whether or not you have qualified for a HELOC, and you will likely pay fees associated with the service. Then, once you get a green light from the lender, you’ll need to visit the office to sign paperwork and then wait about three days before accessing your funds through online transfer or issued checks. The entire process can take a month or longer, and typically involves closing costs of 2% to 5% of the loan amount, as well as fees for origination, appraisal, inactivity and early termination.\n\n**Getting a HELOC Card**\n\nDon’t have a month to wait? A HELOC Card might be a better option. A HELOC Card is backed by your home’s equity, just like a traditional HELOC, but it can take as little as 15 minutes to qualify. To apply, you will still need a credit score in the mid-600s, depending on your equity and debt-to-income ratio, proof of a steady income and enough equity in your home.\n\nHowever, you may be allowed to skip the home appraisal (eliminating any appraisal fees) and sign the closing documents via an online notarization session, which substantially shortens the approval process. The card typically arrives in the mail within 5-10 days, and after the three-day waiting period, you can use it anywhere credit cards are accepted.\n\nA HELOC Card also has significantly lower fees than a traditional HELOC. Skipping the appraisal means you’ll only incur charges for late payments, insufficient funds, and taking out cash.\n\n**Deciding between a HELOC Card and traditional HELOC**\n\nWhen considering whether a traditional HELOC or a HELOC Card is the right choice for you, keep the similarities and differences discussed above in mind. Some people may feel more comfortable signing papers in person or may want to give their favorite bank their business. If this sounds like you, a traditional HELOC may be the way to go. However, if you're looking for the fastest and most affordable way to make your home equity work for you, a HELOC Card may be the best option.\n\nAre you considering applying for a HELOC and looking for the fastest way to do it? Aven can have you approved in as little as 15 minutes.

If so, it’s time to shop around for the best interest rate, which can vary from lender to lender. Keep reading to learn how HELOC interest rates are determined and what external factors affect them.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- Interest rates on HELOCs are determined by the prime lending rate plus a margin set by the lender. The prime rate is the lowest interest rate at which money can be borrowed, and is based on the federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate banks use to lend to one another.\n- The federal funds rate is set by members of the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States. When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, based on current economic conditions, the prime rate moves in accordance and affects HELOC rates.\n- The margin set by the bank depends on your personal financial situation, including your credit score and Combined Loan-to-Value ratio (CLTV). The higher your credit score and lower your CLTV, the lower your margin will typically be.\n\nUnlike the interest rate on mortgages or home equity loans, HELOC rates are adjustable rather than fixed. That means the rate will move up or down overtime based on the benchmark index it is tied to.\n\nHELOC rates are based on two factors: A benchmark rate and your personal financial situation. Interest rates vary by lender, so make sure to do your research and shop around for the best rates before settling on a lender.\n\n**What is the benchmark rate?**\n\nGenerally, lenders set HELOC rates based on the **prime lending rate**, which is the lowest interest rate at which banks will lend money to their most creditworthy clients, typically large corporations. While the prime rate varies from lender to lender, the one published daily by the Wall Street Journal is the most commonly used.\n\nSo, how is the prime rate determined? It is largely influenced by the **federal funds rate**, which is the overnight rate banks use to lend to one another. The federal funds rate is set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is composed of 12 members of the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States. When the FOMC raises the federal funds rate, the prime rate moves with it, which also affects your HELOC rate.\n\nThe FOMC meets eight times a year to review current economic and financial conditions, and decide whether or not to adjust the federal funds rate and, if so, in which direction. If the committee decides to increase the rate several times in a row, your HELOC rate will increase significantly along with it. For that reason, it’s important to check what the maximum interest rate is for your line of credit before settling on a HELOC from any lender.\n\n**What is the markup or margin?**\n\nThe primary factor banks use to determine the markup is your credit score. The higher your credit score, the lower the added margin and, therefore, the lower your HELOC rate will be. However, your Combined Loan-to-Value ratio (CLTV) also matters. The CLTV is the ratio of all secured loans against your property to its value. The lower your CLTV, the lower your rate will typically be.\n\nThe second factor influencing your HELOC rate is your personal financial situation, which determines the markup percentage, or margin, that your lender will add on top of the benchmark rate. For example, if the prime rate is 3.25% and your markup is 2%, your HELOC rate would be 5.25%.\n\nThe amount of money you want to borrow and the duration of your HELOC can also affect your markup. Lower amounts can lead to lower rates, as can shorter drawing and repayment periods.\n\n**HELOC rate discounts**\n\nOccasionally, you may see offers such as \"prime+0%,\" or even negative markup offers like \"prime-1%.\" This is typically an introductory rate, or limited-time offer, meaning your markup will increase after the discount period agreed upon by the lender. Before settling on an offer, make sure to check what the rate will be after this introductory offer ends, or you may be in for a hefty unexpected increase.\n\n**Fixed-rate option**\n\nSome lenders may allow you to convert part, or all, of what you've borrowed into a fixed interest rate during the closing or draw period. This may come with certain limitations, such as a time limit or minimum withdrawal limit. Make sure to talk to your lender about the opportunity of switching between adjustable and fixed interest rates.\n\nAre you considering a HELOC but worried about increasing rates? The interest on the Aven HELOC Card never exceeds 18%, no matter how high the prime rate goes. [Find out more](https://aven.com/) and decide if it\\`s right for you!",

But what is it, what can it be used for and when is a HELOC a good idea?\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- A HELOC is a line of credit backed by your home equity and can be a good idea when you're looking for a way to free up cash for home improvements.\n- There are other options to consider, depending on your situation, and what you want to use the funds for.\n- If a HELOC sounds like a good idea, consider a HELOC Card for a more efficient way to access your funds.\n\n## What is a HELOC?\n\nA HELOC, or Home Equity Line of Credit, is a type of loan that uses your home equity as collateral. If you own at least 20% of your home, you may be able to use that equity to secure a HELOC. A HELOC works like a credit card in the sense that you can use the money when and where you need it. However, interest rates on HELOCs tend to be more competitive because the loan is backed by your home equity. In addition, rates are adjustable and move up or down based on a benchmark rate, such as the federal funds rate. During the initial draw period, which typically lasts five to 10 years, you can pay off your debt and borrow again as much as you’d like. You’ll only pay interest on the amount you withdraw. Then comes the repayment period, during which you pay down your debt by making monthly principal and interest payments.\n\n## What are the alternatives to a HELOC?\n\nBefore settling on a HELOC, you may want to consider other options. Depending on your situation, and what you want to use the funds for, another type of loan may suit your situation better. Let's take a look at some of the alternatives so that you can decide whether a HELOC is a good idea for you.\n\n### Home Equity Loan\n\nA Home Equity Loan, also known as a Second Mortgage, is backed by your home equity, just like a HELOC. The main difference is that this loan is paid out as a lump sum, and once it’s taken out, that’s it. You can’t access additional funds, and when the debt is repaid, the loan is closed. The interest rate for this type of loan is typically fixed. A Home Equity loan can be used to consolidate high-interest debt or to fund home renovations when you have a plan and already know more or less how much you will spend.\n\n### Cash-Out Mortgage Refinance\n\nA Cash-Out Mortgage Refinance may also be a good option if you're looking to make some home improvements. This type of loan replaces your existing mortgage with a loan for more money than you currently owe on your house, and the difference is paid out to you in cash. Your monthly mortgage payments will be higher as a result. Like the Home Equity Loan above, once you’re finished originating the loan, it’s done; you cannot draw additional funds like you would on a HELOC.\n\n### Reverse Mortgage\n\nIf you are older than 62, a Reverse Mortgage is another choice. As the name suggests, this type of loan works in the opposite way of a traditional mortgage: The lender makes payments to you in exchange for equity in your home, and your equity decreases as your debt increases. The loan balance doesn’t become due until you sell the property or pass away. This type of loan can be a good alternative when you want to retire but don't have enough savings and assets to do so. Scams are common, so do your research and be careful.\n\n### Personal Loan\n\nAnother option to look into is a Personal Loan, which could be unsecured or secured against something valuable - like a car, for example. Personal Loans are often used to consolidate credit card debt or other high-interest debt, but keep in mind that the interest rates for personal loans can also be high compared with a HELOC.\n\n## Advantages of a HELOC\n\nThere are a few advantages of choosing a HELOC over the types of loans described above. First, the interest rates are usually lower than for other kinds of loans. Secondly, some lenders offer low or no closing cost and some may not charge fees for withdrawing cash. Finally, if you use your funds for home improvements or renovations, the interest on your HELOC may be tax-deductible.\n\n## When is a HELOC a Good Idea?\n\nA HELOC may be the best choice if you are looking to use the funds for home improvements or renovations, which will increase the value of your home. It’s an especially good option if you’re unsure how much money you will need for the project because you’re able to withdraw funds as you go, while only paying interest on what you use. On the other hand, if you’re looking to free up cash for something like a car, which will not increase your wealth, another type of loan may be less risky. As discussed, a HELOC is backed by your home equity, which puts your home at risk should you not be able to pay back your debt.\n\n## What is a HELOC Card?\n\nIf you've determined a HELOC is a good idea for you, consider getting a HELOC Card. It can take weeks to receive approval for a traditional HELOC, while a HELOC Card takes as little as 15 minutes and allows you to skip the home appraisal process. Once approved, the card arrives in the mail in a few days. After a three-day waiting period, you'll be free to use the card anywhere credit cards are accepted. With a traditional HELOC, you will usually need to use a special checkbook or online transfers to access your funds.\n\nDoes a HELOC seem like a good idea? If you're looking for a HELOC Card, Aven can get you approved in as fast as 15 minutes.

But I was initially skeptical that their core product would scale in the staid, calcified industry structure that has prevailed in the mortgage market for decades. The Aven team is proving the skeptics wrong in a big way. I am thrilled to be their partner,” said Kevin Warsh, Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.\n\nAven is currently available in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming with a goal of reaching all 50 states by 2025.\n\nFor more information visit [www.aven.com](https://www.aven.com/).\n\nAbout Aven\n\nAven is the best credit card for smart homeowners.

Keep reading to learn how HELOCs on rental properties work, how to get one and what it can be used for.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- It is possible to open a HELOC on a rental property, just like you can on your primary residence.\n- However, not all lenders offer HELOCs on investment properties because, in the event of financial hardship, the owner is more likely to prioritize their primary home over a rental property.\n- As a result, qualifying for a HELOC on an investment property may be more challenging and requires a higher credit score than for a HELOC on your primary residence.\n\n**How Do HELOCs Work?**\n\nA HELOC allows you to tap into the equity you’ve acquired in your home to help pay for home improvements and renovations. Mathematically, the amount is the current market value of the property minus the outstanding balance on the primary mortgage. A HELOC carries less risk for lenders than other types of loans because the home is used as collateral in the case of a default and, therefore, comes with competitive interest rates for the borrower.\n\nA HELOC is made up of two phases: A draw period that typically lasts five to 10 years and a repayment period that lasts between 10 and 20 years. During the draw period, you can use the line of credit to borrow cash, repay it, and borrow more, much like an ordinary credit card. You only have to pay back what you spend, plus interest. During the repayment phase, you can no longer withdraw funds and start paying down debt in the form of monthly principal and interest payments. To learn more about how HELOCs work, take a look at [this article](https://www.aven.com/education/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit-heloc-a-beginners-guide).\n\nIf you're a real estate investor, you may be wondering if it's possible to take out a HELOC on a rental property. The short answer is yes. However, there's a lot to consider before applying.\n\n**HELOCs on an Investment Property**\n\nA HELOC on an investment property functions in the exact same way as a HELOC on a personal property, but the process of acquiring one can prove much more challenging due to the increased risk for the lender.\n\nFinding a Lender\n\nNot all lenders offer HELOCs on rental properties because the risk of default is much higher than with personal properties. In the event of a financial hardship, the borrower is much more likely to prioritize paying the loan on their primary property before paying down debt on a secondary property, whether that’s in the form of a HELOC or mortgage. In the case of a foreclosure, the sale proceeds would first go toward paying off the mortgage before any other liens on the property, such as a HELOC.\n\nThe best way to find a lender that offers investment property HELOCs is to leverage your existing network of real estate investors who have already qualified for a HELOC. Online forums and real estate investing groups may also be helpful.\n\nRequirements for Rental Property HELOCs\n\nDue to the increased risks discussed above, rental property HELOCs are more expensive and come with stricter requirements than for HELOCs on primary residences. The interest rate is typically higher and the borrower must shell out cash for an additional appraisal and title search fees, among other costs.\n\nTo qualify, you’ll need a FICO credit score of 720 or above, versus just 620 for a HELOC on a personal property. The lender will also consider your combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) and debt-to-income ratio (DTI), both of which will need to be low.\n\nUnlike a HELOC on a personal property, lenders oftentimes require the borrower to wait a full year after purchasing the rental property before being eligible for a HELOC so they can prove that they have trustworthy tenants that will make payments on time and provide sufficient cash flow. The lender may also require you to have a large cash reserve on hand that’s equivalent to 18 to 24 months of payments.\n\n**What Can an Investment Property HELOC be Used For?**\n\nA HELOC on an investment property can be used in the exact same way as a HELOC on a personal property. They are most commonly used to pay for renovations and improvements to the property, but can also be used to consolidate high-interest debt, purchase a new property, or anything else you'd like. However, experts advise that HELOCs be used for investments that will grow your wealth over time, rather than for purchases that will not, such as cars or vacation trips.\n\nCurrently Aven’s product is not available for rental or investment properties. Are you considering applying for a HELOC for your primary residence? With Aven's HELOC Card, you can get approved in as fast as 15 minutes and have the card in your hands in a few days.

That includes applicant IDs.\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Payments\n\n- When will my mailed check payment be posted to my account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nWe prefer electronic payments through the Aven mobile app, or through your financial institution’s bill pay system. As a courtesy, we will accept check payments you mail us. It may take up to 5 business days for mail to be delivered by the post office.

The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator)\n\n- How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).\n\n- Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails)\n\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\n\n- How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\n\n\n- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\n- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\n- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\n\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\n\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\n\n- When is the monthly payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: [https://my.aven.com/statements](https://my.aven.com/statements)\n\n- How can I make a payment on my monthly statement? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card  app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail.

This does NOT impact the applicant's credit score.

Your Cardholder agreement will specify the Index used for your account.\n\n\n\nWall Street Journal Prime (WSJ Prime): The Wall Street Journal surveys some of the country's biggest banks and publishes a consensus rate based on the survey. This is one of the most common indicies used for many lending products. Look up the latest rates on the [website of the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates). https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates\n\n\n\nFederal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (FFTR-UL): This rate is set by the Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve (FOMC). It is the short-term interest rate at which U.S. Banks and Credit Unions lend to each other overnight within the Federal Reserve system. Look up the latest rates on the [website of the St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM). [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM)\n\n\n\nThe rate on your account is the sum of the index and the margin. Both can be found in your Account Agreement.\n\n- Do you give a HUD-1? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\n\n\nThere is no HUD-1 form associated with the Aven Home Card. The Account Agreement contains all the required information, notices, and disclosures.\n\n- How do applicants get higher credit limits? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor applicants, Aven's automated underwriting system cannot modify the credit limit or rate. Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\n- What is my monthly interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nA cardholder's monthly interest rate is their current APR, divided by 365, multiplied by the number of days in that monthly billing cycle.For fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation. Cardholders can find their current rates in the Aven App (under \"Account Details\").  The effective APR for each billing cycle is also printed in the statement..\n\n- Is the rate variable? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe Aven Card is a variable rate credit card. Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\n\n- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\n- Is Aven a simple interest loan or does it have an amortization schedule? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven offers several balance plans and some of them use the simple interest method of interest calculation.\n\nFor revolving balances, Aven uses the Average Daily Balance method of interest calculation. For each billing cycle, we add the interest bearing balance on each day of the cycle and divide it by the number of days in the cycle to get the Average Daily Balance for the billing cycle. We then calculate interest on this balance for the duration of the billing cycle, using the rate in effect on the last day of the billing cycle. Cardholders can find the rate used for the cycle on their statement in the \"Plan Summary\" section towards the end.\n\nFor fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation. (Some Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment fixed rate Installment plans for 5, 10, 15, or 30 years. Please check your account agreement to see if you have these plans.)\n\nFor payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator)\n\n- How can someone get a lower rate compared to the offered? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated,  offers based on applicants’ income, equity, credit, and debt obligations. Aven can not adjust offers.\n\n- Does Aven offer a fixed rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans. Applicants can check their details in their account agreement.\n\n- What is the maximum line size? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nCurrently the maximum line size Aven offers is $250k. Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\n- Are there caps on rates? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe Aven Card rate will vary based on the Index - either Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) or the Federal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (FFTR-UL) set by the Federal Reserve. Please look at your account agreement for which the Index is used in your account. The maximum APR is 18%. The latest WSJ Prime Rate and FFTR-UL Rate can be found on the public internet at the Wall Street Journal webpage, or the Federal Reserve webpage.\n\n- Are there any origination or annual fees? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe Aven Card comes without application fees, annual fees, or account closing fees. Select offers for some customers might include first-draw fees, clearly indicated at the time of the offer.\n\n- Would the effective interest rate stay the same for fixed monthly payment plans? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe effective interest rate may vary for fixed monthly payment plans. On the day a cardholder sets up a fixed monthly payment plan, the rate is calculated as the account's current variable rate + a Fixed Rate premium (For some Aven cardholders, it may vary, see your account agreement).\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Application\n\n- A co-owner is deceased and I am trying to open an account.

An email notifying you of the form and containing a link to the document was sent out on Jan 31, 2025. You can also view and download previous year Form 1098s at the same location in your \"Documents\".\n\nBox 1 of the Form 1098 contains the total interest you paid during 2024. To be included in this Box, the interest must have been actually paid between Jan 01, 2024 and Dec 31, 2024. If you got a statement in Dec 2024 which you paid in Jan 2025, that amount will not be included in the Form 1098 for 2024.\n\nBox 2 of the Form 1098 contains the total principal that you had on Jan 01, 2024 and any additional draws or purchases you took during the year, up through Dec 31, 2024. This amount is not the current principal on your account. You will see an amount here even if your account was paid off and closed during 2024. This amount is for IRS Reporting purposes, you total amount owed may be different.\n\nPlease consult tax rules or a tax advisor to determine whether your interest payments are tax deductible.\n\n- Why is the pending transaction amount different from the purchase? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nMerchants such as gas stations or restaurants usually request an authorization for an estimated amount before completing the transaction with the final amount. The same applies with pre-authorizations for hotel or car rentals.\n\n- How long does it take to get my card? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe Aven card generally arrives within 7 business days from the time your account was opened.

If the person on the receiving end becomes a cardholder using the PIF link sent to them, they receive statement credit which they have the option of sharing with the person who sent them the original PIF link.\n\n- When will I get my sign-on incentive under the pay-it-forward program? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nCardholders who applied for an Aven Card through a program link sent by a friend will receive their sign-on incentive as a statement credit in their first statement (typically generated within 30 days from account opening).\n\n- I lost my card or it was stolen.

Notary sessions are conducted fully online. All signers will have their own signing session. The signer needs to have their original, unexpired government issued photo ID, a mobile phone with a working video camera, microphone, and high speed internet.\n\n- Who needs to sign the agreements? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAll applicants need to sign the Account Agreement, Deed of Trust, Power of Attorney, and notice of right to cancel.

Aven does not accept POAs for signatures, except for active duty personnel who are deployed overseas with a military POA.\n\n- My ID has expired. What can I do to complete the notarization process? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nTo complete the notary session, applicants need to have their original, unexpired identification document, such as Driver's License, Passport Book, Passport Card, etc. If an ID is expired or damaged, the applicant must obtain a valid ID before the notary session.\n\n- How long does someone have to complete the notarization after applying? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nApplicants have 30 calendar days from beginning the application to accept an offer, if given. In addition, applicants have 30 calendar days from accepting their offer to completing the notarization session.\n\n- How can someone complete a notary session if an additional signer is not available at the same time or is in a different place? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThis is not an issue. Aven's notary system can easily schedule two separate notary appointments.\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Debt Protection\n\n- Does Aven make any money from Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo, Aven does not make any money from this product.

Even if you are not able to pay your minimum monthly payment for Aven, as long as you pay your Debt Protection fees, you will be eligible to file a claim.\n\n- Can I appeal a claim decision for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no option to appeal at this time. Securian's claim decision is final.\n\n- Do I need to be current on my account to file a Debt Protection claim? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo. You may file a claim even if you are delinquent. However, you will need to remit the Debt Protection fees owed in order to process the claim. The cardholder has active coverage if the protection has not lapsed. Please note, if a claim is successful, it will not bring your account current.\n\n- Are there any exclusions to filing a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt protection is not possible in the following cases:\n\n\n- A customer retires, quits, or resigns\n- A claim occurs in first 90 days of issuance\n- A claim occurs on or after 70th birthday\n\n- How do I file a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nEmail us at support@aven.com or go to the Debt Protection tab located in the sidebar menu of your Aven mobile application.\n\nThere you will see a link to file a claim. You will be routed to Securian Financial - our claims administrator - to provide details related to your job loss event and submit documentation.\n\nOnce a decision has been made, Securian Financial will notify you and Aven and issue a payment to Aven under the contractual liability policy. Please note that the cancellation date would be effective as of the date of unemployment.\n\n- How are Debt Protection fees calculated? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe monthly rate charged is $0.92 per $1,000 of balances for single accounts and $1.75 per $1,000 of balances for joint accounts.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you have $30,000 of outstanding balances at your statement date, you would see a $27.60 charge as a single account holder and a $52.50 charge as a joint account holder in the following statement. Fees are always paid for balances in arrears.\n\n\n\nThis fee will show up on your monthly statement as a separate charge. As long as you are current on paying these fees, you will be able to file a claim in the event of involuntary job loss.\n\n- How much am I covered for with Debt Protection? Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\n\n\n\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\n\n\n\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.\n\n- Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower’s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved.\n\n\n\nAven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.\n\n- Who is eligible for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIn order to qualify, you must:\n\n\n- Be under 70 years old\n- Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week\n- Not be self-employed\n\n- What is Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home.\n\n\n\nPlease note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due. Additionally, your first lien holder may still foreclose if you fall into default on mortgage payments.\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Can't find what you need?\n\nSearch question, keywords, or topics\n\nMessage Us  Schedule A Callback",

Online advertising involves various parties engaged in the processing of Personal Information in connection with the delivery, analysis, and other processing related to our online advertising activities. For example, these third parties may, on our behalf, augment your profile with demographic and other information, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a transaction for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement. We generally use online advertising for the purpose of marketing our Services and goods and services of our affiliates and related parties, as part of our marketing communications, or in connection with the development of marketing profiles or audiences.\n\n# How We Disclose Information\n\nWe may disclose information we collect with third parties, depending upon the purpose for and context in which we obtained the information, as described below.

If you have opted only to pay interest during the draw period, you may be shocked at the new, higher monthly payments of interest and principal that are now required, and you may wonder, can a HELOC be refinanced? It is possible to refinance a HELOC. If you are thinking about it, you have a few options to choose from, and you may be able to keep your HELOC.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\nThere are a few ways that a HELOC can be refinanced and payments decreased. Your options are to request a loan modification to your current HELOC, get a new HELOC, refinance your HELOC and mortgage into a new first mortgage, or get a home equity loan to pay off your HELOC.\nYou may want to refinance your HELOC if you're having a hard time making the monthly payments and want better loan terms. Refinancing could also help you lock in a low fixed interest rate. Another reason to refinance is that you may need more time and funds to make further home improvements.\n\nEach refinance option comes with its own set of pros and cons. Carefully consider each option and your situation before deciding which alternative suits your needs the best.\n\n**Reasons to Refinance a HELOC**\n\nA HELOC is a type of revolving credit line backed by the equity you have in your home, which means your property is used as collateral and secures the line of credit. HELOCs are divided into two phases: the draw period, during which you can borrow money from the credit line, repay, and borrow again, and the repayment period, during which you pay back any outstanding balance.\n\nDuring the draw period of your HELOC you are only required to pay interest on what you borrow. During the repayment period you can no longer withdraw funds, and you have to make monthly payments of principal and interest. If you've opted to pay only the interest during the draw period, you may be shocked at the increased monthly payments once you reach the repayment phase. Refinancing your HELOC may help make payments more affordable and could also allow you to take advantage of interest rates trending lower.\n\nAnother reason to refinance is that you may need more time and funds to make further home improvements. If your home's value has increased, you may be able to get more money from your home equity to complete the additional projects.\n\n**Ways to Refinance a HELOC**\n\nThere are a few ways to refinance your HELOC. Consider your situation and your reason for refinancing, and make sure to check your options with several lenders before settling on a solution.\n\nApply for a Loan Modification\n\nThe first option when you're having difficulties making payments is to request a loan modification. Your lender may lower the interest rate or increase the repayment term to make your monthly payments more affordable and help you avoid defaulting.\n\nTo get your loan modification request approved, you will have to prove to your lender that you will be able to make payments under the new, negotiated terms. Keep in mind that not all lenders offer loan modifications.\n\nGet a New HELOC\n\nIf you want to buy time before entering the repayment phase, you may choose to open a new HELOC. This allows you to extend the draw period and its interest-only payment requirement and avoid principal payments for a while longer. This option may also be good if your home value has increased and you want to make a few more adjustments or improvements to your home and need more time and funds to do so.\n\nGetting a new HELOC and draw period may tempt you to borrow more, so make sure not to borrow beyond your means. Remember that you will eventually need to pay back your loan, and the longer you put it off, the higher your interest and your monthly payments will be. Also, keep in mind that because HELOC rates are adjustable, they may keep going up.\n\nRefinance Your Mortgage and HELOC Together\n\nAnother option is to refinance your mortgage and HELOC together into a new first mortgage. This way, you may be able to secure a significantly lower interest rate. First mortgage rates are generally lower than both HELOC rates and home equity loan rates, as the first mortgage lender is first in line to profit if you were to default on payments and your house was to get foreclosed on.\n\nA new first mortgage usually has a fixed interest rate, making your monthly payments more predictable and plannable, but keep in mind that closing costs may be high.\n\nGet a Home Equity Loan to Pay Off Your HELOC\n\nYour fourth option is to get a home equity loan, also called a second mortgage, to pay off your HELOC. Since a home equity loan is paid out in a lump sum, you can use it to pay off your HELOC, and you won't be tempted to keep borrowing, as can happen with a revolving credit line. You will also get the stability of a fixed interest rate and steady monthly payments that don't change. The downside can be closing costs and fees and the fact that a long, drawn-out payment period can increase the total interest you will have to pay.\n\nAre you considering getting a HELOC? Aven can get you approved in as fast as 15 minutes. [Find out more](http://aven.com/) and decide if it is the right choice for you!",

If so, you have probably thought about getting a second mortgage in the form of a loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). But did you know it is possible to access your funds instantly using a credit card? This article explains the concept of a HELOC Card, how it’s different from a traditional HELOC, as well as the benefits and disadvantages.\n\n**What is a HELOC?**\n\nLet’s first explore what a HELOC is. With this type of loan you borrow funds against the equity you’ve built in your home: the value minus the outstanding balance on the primary mortgage. You can use the funds whenever you need cash, and you do not pay interest on unused funds. Because your house is used as collateral in exchange for funds, HELOCs typically come with competitive interest rates versus other types of loans. However, HELOC interest rates are generally variable, meaning they move up or down based on a benchmark rate, like the federal funds rate. For that reason, it’s important to consider the maximum rate for your HELOC when deciding whether or not to open one.\n\nThere are two phases of a HELOC: The draw period, which typically lasts five to 10 years, and the repayment period, which usually lasts 10 to 20 years. During the draw period, you can use the line of credit much like an ordinary credit card: borrow cash, repay debt, and borrow more cash. You’re only required to pay for what you spend, plus interest. During the repayment phase, borrowing stops and the focus shifts to paying down debt in the form of monthly principal and interest payments.\n\n**What can a HELOC be used for?**\n\nHELOCs are oftentimes used to pay for home improvements and remodeling, which can help increase the value of the home. In addition, the interest on a HELOC may be tax-deductible if used to purchase, build or make significant improvements to a home.\n\nHowever, there are risks to consider. Because the interest rate is variable, an increase could make it more difficult to keep up with monthly payments and, consequently, increase the risk of foreclosure.\n\n**What is a HELOC Card?**\n\nNow that you understand what a HELOC is, let's talk about HELOC Cards. A HELOC Card allows you to access funds immediately to pay for items and services when you need them. This card acts just like a credit card and can be used anywhere credit cards are accepted, but typically has a much lower interest rate because it is secured by your home equity. HELOC cards can also be used to transfer balances from other credit cards and personal loans.\n\n**Benefits of HELOC Cards**\n\nThere are several benefits to a HELOC Card. You can use it anytime, anywhere, just like any other credit card, and get instant access to your line of credit. The interest rate on your card is usually lower than other credit cards because it uses your home as collateral. If you use your HELOC Card to pay for home improvements, the interest on your HELOC Card may be tax-deductible, and you never pay interest on unused funds.\n\nCompared with a regular HELOC, a HELOC Card may have significantly lower fees, and you may be avoiding the high credit minimums that ordinary HELOCs require. It can also be much faster to receive a HELOC Card than to get a traditional HELOC.\n\n**Key takeaways**\n\n- A HELOC is a line of credit backed by your home equity. This type of loan is typically suitable for purchases that help build wealth, such as home improvements or remodelings, but can also be used for other purposes, such as paying off high-interest credit card debt or personal loans.\n- HELOCs commonly have low interest rates, though they’re variable and move up or down based on a benchmark rate.\n- A HELOC Card allows you to access your funds immediately when you need them and works just like any other credit card. It may be faster to acquire than a traditional HELOC and may also incur significantly lower fees.\n\nAre you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back.

As with all loans, this type of transaction isn’t free and it’s important to shop around for a competitive interest rate. But you may be wondering: Are HELOC rates fixed or variable? Well, they can be both. Let us explain.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- The interest rate on a HELOC is generally variable, which means it moves up and down in accordance with the benchmark rate it is tied to.\n- The prime rate is the most commonly used benchmark rate for HELOCs. The prime rate is largely based on the federal funds rate, which is set by members of the Federal Reserve.\n- Some lenders may provide an option to convert a variable rate to a fixed rate, which can help you budget and keep monthly payments stable for an agreed-upon term.\n- Converting your HELOC to a fixed rate may come with fees or minimum withdrawal requirements, so check the conditions with your lender before deciding whether or not to convert.\n\n**Variable-Rate HELOCs**\n\nThe interest rate on a traditional HELOC is usually variable, meaning it won't necessarily be the same every month. To understand how and why HELOC rates vary, we first need to understand how the index rate works.\n\n**Variable interest rates** are tied to an index, or benchmark, rate and increase or decrease based on moves in that rate. The index most commonly used for HELOCs is the **prime rate**, which the big banks charge their most creditworthy clients, who are generally large corporations. The prime rate changes over time because it is based primarily on the federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC meets eight times a year to decide whether to raise or lower the federal funds rate based on current economic conditions. When the FOMC decides to change its rate, it affects the prime rate and, in turn, your HELOC rate.\n\nIn addition to the prime rate, the lender adds a markup based on your credit score, combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) and payment history. Generally, the lower your CLTV ratio and higher your credit score, the better your rate will be.\n\nWhen shopping around for a HELOC, you may see offers like \"prime+0%\" or \"prime-1%\". These are introductory or limited-time offers, so your rate will go up after a predetermined amount of time. Also keep in mind that, even if your lender offers you a low initial rate, the FOMC could increase the prime rate several times in a row, leading to an increase in your HELOC rate.\n\n**Fixed-Rate Option**\n\nSome lenders offer the option to convert all or part of your loan to a fixed interest rate, which means that your rate will stay the same for a determined term, no matter what direction the prime rate and federal funds rate moves. With a fixed rate, you can stabilize your monthly payments and avoid any uncertainty. Converting your HELOC can usually be done at closing or any time during the draw period.\n\nThe fixed-rate term could last anywhere from one to 30 years, depending on the lender. Some lenders only offer limited terms, or may require minimum withdrawals. You could also be asked to pay a small fee to convert your variable-rate HELOC to a fixed interest rate. The longer it takes to pay off your debt, the more interest you will pay in the long run.\n\nIt may be worth it to convert a variable-rate HELOC to a fixed rate if you think the prime rate will increase, or want more control over your monthly payments. However, if you choose to convert and the prime rate falls, you lose out on a lower rate. Ultimately, the decision depends on your personal situation and how comfortable you are with current economic conditions.\n\nAre you considering a HELOC, but worried about the variable interest rate rising? With the Aven HELOC Card, your rate will never exceed 18%, no matter how high the prime rate goes. [Read about it here](http://aven.com/) and decide if it's right for you!",

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education#footnote_1)\n\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\n\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\n\nFor Cash Outs and Balance Transfers, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education#footnote_4)\n\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\n\nWhat is my monthly payment?\n\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees.

A Beginner’s Guide\n\n![What is a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)? A Beginner’s Guide](https://www.aven.com/img/whatIsAHomeEquityLineOfCreditHelocABeginnersGuide.8e019f87.webp)\n\n###### Published Jul 21, 2021 \\| 3 min read\n\nThere are many options to consider when you need to free up cash for a project or purchase, such as credit card cash advances, personal loans, reverse mortgages and home equity loans. But have you ever considered a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), which allows you to tap into your home equity to fund home improvements or renovations? If you haven’t, read on to discover how a HELOC works and why it may be a good option for you.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- A HELOC is a line of credit that is backed by the equity you have in your home, meaning your house is used as collateral to secure the loan.\n- A HELOC is recommended for investments that will increase your wealth, such as home improvements. It's not recommended for day-to-day living expenses or expensive purchases like cars or vacations.\n- HELOC rates are determined using a baseline rate, typically the prime rate, and your credit profile. Typically, the higher your credit score, the lower the rate.\n- HELOC rates are variable, meaning they move up or down in accordance with the benchmark rate. Remember to check your HELOC's maximum rate when applying to avoid a costly surprise.\n\n## What is a HELOC?\n\nA HELOC is a line of credit backed by the equity you have in your home: the value of your home minus what you owe on your mortgage. A HELOC uses your home equity as collateral and lets you borrow against it.\n\nFor example, let's say you make a down payment of 20% on a house worth $200,000 and take out a mortgage to cover the rest. That means you initially have $40,000 worth of equity in your home, which increases as you make monthly payments on your mortgage. If you have at least 20% equity in your home (and meet a few other requirements - read more here), you may qualify for a HELOC.\n\nA HELOC consists of two phases. The first is the draw period, which usually lasts five to 10 years, and the repayment period, which can last 10 to 20 years. During the draw period, you are free to use your line of credit at your discretion, up to your limit. It functions much like a credit card: borrow cash, repay it and borrow again. You also only pay interest on what you use. When the draw period is over, the repayment phase begins. This is where you make monthly principal and interest payments to pay back what you've borrowed during the draw phase.\n\n## How are HELOC rates determined?\n\nHELOC interest rates are determined based on a benchmark interest rate, typically the prime rate, as well as your credit profile. Depending on your credit score, the lender will add a markup to the benchmark rate. Typically, the lower your credit score, the higher the interest you’ll have to pay. If you have an excellent credit history, your rate could be as low as 3%, while if your credit is below average, it could be as high as 9-10%.\n\nBecause HELOCs are secured by home equity, the interest rates tend to be lower than with other types of loans. However, they are variable, meaning your rate will move up and down over time with the benchmark rate it is tied to. This means your monthly payments may increase, making it harder to keep up with payments. It is critical to consider this and check the maximum rate for your HELOC when deciding if it’s the right choice for you.\n\n## How do homeowners benefit from HELOCs?\n\nThe biggest benefit of a HELOC is the ability to withdraw funds as you go and only pay interest on what you use, unlike other loans that require you to take out a lump sum and pay interest on the entire balance from the get-go. In addition, if the HELOC funds are used to pay for home improvement projects and renovations, which boost the value of the property over time, the interest may be tax-deductible. To learn more, [read here](https://www.aven.com/education/when-are-helocs-home-equity-lines-of-credit-a-good-idea) about when a HELOC may (or may not) be a good idea.\n\n## How do lenders benefit from offering HELOCs?\n\nFor lenders, HELOCs offer protection if things go downhill because the borrower’s property serves as collateral. If a borrower defaults on payments, the bank could ultimately take ownership of the home and sell it to pay off the loan.

Hodl & spend.\n\nEasily leverage your crypto assets to get access to a super low-cost Aven Visa Credit Card. Only use what you need, when you need.\n\nSimple Rate + 2% Cash Back1\n\nOne low rate of 6.99% Variable APR plus unlimited 2% cash back on every purchase – you earn every time you spend. Buy anything from donuts to cars to NFTs.\n\nDon't Sell. Hodl & Spend\n\nUse your crypto assets to make purchases anywhere that VISA is accepted – without selling. You can also send cash directly to your bank.\n\nSave on Taxes\n\nSelling crypto can result in a taxable gain or loss. Instead, you could save on taxes by spending without selling. Consult a tax advisor.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. 1.\n\n\nHodl Crypto\n\n\n\nSecurely deposit crypto into your Aven Wallet to get access to credit.\n\n2. 2.\n\n\nGet Credit\n\n\n\nGet credit at a really low rate with your Aven Visa Credit Card. You can also cash out directly to your bank account.\n\n3. 3.\n\n\nFlexible Payback\n\n\n\nOnly pay for what you use and pay back flexibly starting at 1% min monthly payment, just like any other credit card. No prepayment fees, no origination fees, no gotchas.\n\n\nLine Of Credit\n\n$50,000\n\nLine of Credit Amount\n\nCollateral\n\nRequired\n\nBTC1.31\n\nYou can get a line of credit up to 35% of the value of your collateral up to $100,000\n\n## Common questions\n\nIs it secure?\n\nBest-in-class security, compliance, and infrastructure with BitGo. Your crypto is stored using state of the art multi-signature security and 3-key management with SOC 2 Type 2 compliance.\n\nHow is my limit calculated?\n\nYour limit is based on the amount of crypto you hold into your Aven wallet. You can get a line of credit up to 35% of the value of your collateral up to a $100,000.\n\nWhat happens if crypto values drops?\n\nIf the value of your deposited crypto drops and your balance exceeds more than 65% of the crypto value, we'll ask you to deposit more or make a payment to bring your balance to below 65% of the deposited crypto value. If it exceeds 85%, we will immediately make a payment to your card to get it to 65% by selling some of your crypto.\n\nWhat does HODL mean?\n\nHODL originated as a misspelling of the word \"hold.\" Often used as a phrase in the crypto world to mean \"not selling.\"\n\n![Card Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/whatIcon.f0d86dbe.svg)\n\n## Join the waitlist\n\nMobile Number\n\nJoin The Waitlist\n\nJoining the waitlist will NOT affect your credit score.\n\n†By providing your number, you consent to automated or manual marketing messages & to Aven's [Terms of Service](https://www.aven.com/docs/TermsOfUse.pdf) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.aven.com/docs/PrivacyPolicy.html).
